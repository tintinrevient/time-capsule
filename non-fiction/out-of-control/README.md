# Out of control

* "That is, the more **mechanical** we make our fabricated environment, the more **biological** it will eventually have to be if it is to work at all."

* "**Milk cows** and **carrots**, therefore, are human inventions as much as **steam engines** and **gunpowder** are. But milk cows and carrots are more indicative of the kind of inventions humans will make in the future: products that are **grown** rather than **manufactured**."

* "Two concrete trends are happening: (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and (2) Life is becoming more **engineered**."
