# Out of control

* "That is, the more **mechanical** we make our fabricated environment, the more **biological** it will eventually have to be if it is to work at all."

* "**Milk cows** and **carrots**, therefore, are human inventions as much as **steam engines** and **gunpowder** are. But milk cows and carrots are more indicative of the kind of inventions humans will make in the future: products that are **grown** rather than **manufactured**."

* "Two concrete trends are happening: (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and (2) Life is becoming more **engineered**."

* "Ours may always be a **flashy** type of creativity, but there is something to be said for a **slow**, **wide** creativity of many dim parts working ceaselessly."

* "This is a universal law of vivisystems: higher-level complexities **cannot be inferred** by lower-level existences."

* "**Nothing** — no computer or mind, no means of mathematics, physics, or philosophy — can unravel the **emergent pattern** dissolved in the parts without actually playing it out."

* "The theorists put it this way: running a system is the quickest, shortest, and only sure method to discern emergent structures latent in it. There are no shortcuts to actually **“expressing”** a convoluted, nonlinear equation to discover what it does."
