# Out of control

* "That is, the more **mechanical** we make our fabricated environment, the more **biological** it will eventually have to be if it is to work at all."

* "**Milk cows** and **carrots**, therefore, are human inventions as much as **steam engines** and **gunpowder** are. But milk cows and carrots are more indicative of the kind of inventions humans will make in the future: products that are **grown** rather than **manufactured**."

* "Two concrete trends are happening: (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and (2) Life is becoming more **engineered**."

* "Ours may always be a **flashy** type of creativity, but there is something to be said for a **slow**, **wide** creativity of many dim parts working ceaselessly."

* "This is a universal law of vivisystems: higher-level complexities **cannot be inferred** by lower-level existences."

* "**Nothing** — no computer or mind, no means of mathematics, physics, or philosophy — can unravel the **emergent pattern** dissolved in the parts without actually playing it out."

* "The theorists put it this way: running a system is the quickest, shortest, and only sure method to discern emergent structures latent in it. There are no shortcuts to actually **“expressing”** a convoluted, nonlinear equation to discover what it does."

* "What is contained in a human that will **not emerge until** we are all interconnected by wires and politics?"

* "Retrieval from memory involves selecting out of a vast field of things what’s important and what is not important, emphasizing the important stuff, downplaying the unimportant. **That selection process is perception**."

* "**The core processes of cognition** are very, very tightly related to **perception**."

* "The problem with our robots today is that we don’t respect them. They are stuck in factories without windows, doing jobs that humans don’t want to do. **we take machines as slaves, but they are not that**."

* "you can’t have intelligence without **a society of mind**. we can **only get smart things from stupid things**."

* "The distributed mass of ricocheting impulses which form the foundation of intelligence forbid deterministic results for
a given starting point. Instead of **repeatable results**, outcomes are merely **probabilistic**."

* "There is **no explicit communication** between the behavior agents. all communication occurs through **observing the effects of actions** that other agents have on the external world."

* "The world itself becomes the 'central' controller; **the unmapped environment becomes the map**. Within this kind of organization, **very small amounts of computation** are needed to generate intelligent behaviors."

* "Tight coupling of sensors to actuators — **reflexes**, **not thinking**."

* "sparse communication — **watch results in the world**, not wires."

* "Almost every lesson from the Mobot Lab seems to teach that **there is no mind without body** in **a real unforgiving world**. **To think is to act**, and **to act is to think**." (**survival**)

* "**What color is a chameleon on a mirror?**" (**virtual reality**)

* "The chameleon responding to its own shifting image is an apt analog of the human world of fashion."

* "Medieval life was remarkably **unnarcissistic**. Common folk had only vague notions of their own image in the broad sense. Their individual and social identities were informed by participating in rituals and traditions rather than by reflection. On the other hand, **the modern world is being paved with mirrors**."

* "In the physical universe the effect that one event has on another tends to decrease with **the distance in time or in space between them**. In computation there is no analog of distance. One memory location is as easily influenced as another."

* "An organism’s gene-pattern does not specify in detail how a kitten shall catch a mouse, but provides a learning mechanism and a tendency to play, so that **it is the mouse which teaches the kitten the finer points of how to catch mice**."

* "**'the shadow of the future'** cast by playing a game repeatedly rather than once encouraged cooperation."

* "In zero-sum games you always try to **hide your strategy**, but in nonzero-sum games you might want to announce your strategy in public so the other players need to **adapt to it**."

* "If you create predator/prey relationships in silico, what conditions cause the virtual organisms to settle into a long-term coevolutionary duet, and what conditions cause them to crash?"

* "I finally figured out that the way to get wonderfully lifelike behavior is not to try to make a really complex creature, but to **make a wonderfully rich environment for a simple creature**."

* "The reason life cannot be halted is that the complexity of life’s dynamics has exceeded the complexity of all known destructive forces."

* "Ktesibios’s regula was the first nonliving object to self-regulate, self-govern, and self-control. Thus, it became the first **self to be born outside of biology**."

* "The organism is the cause and effect of itself, its own intrinsic order and organization. **Natural selection** isn’t the cause of organisms. **Genes** don’t cause organisms. There are no causes of organisms. **Organisms are self-causing agencies**."

* "**A system is anything that talks to itself**. All living systems and organisms ultimately reduce to a bunch of regulators — chemical pathways and neuron circuits — having conversations as dumb as **'I want, I want, I want; no, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t.'**"
