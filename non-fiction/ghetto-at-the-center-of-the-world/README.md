* "The biggest reason why so many people in Hong Kong and in the developed world are terrified of Chungking Mansions is simply that they are afraid of the developing world and the masses of poor people who come to the developed world for some of the crumbs of its wealth."

* "The gap between the rich and the poor, between owners and temporary workers, between the large entrepreneurs and the small traders, is enormous in Chungking Mansions, but most view it as a fact of life rather than an injustice."

* "Throughout the world, the passage of goods takes place to an extraordinary degree beyond governmental control; less than five percent of the goods passing through the world's ports are ever inspected."
