# Solaris

* "In fact, by no means everybody was yet convinced that the ocean was actually a living 'creature', and still less, it goes without saying, a **rational** one."

* "Also, by calling on the most abstruse branches of **statistical** analysis, it was possible to classify certain frequencies in the discharges of current."

* "We have no need of other worlds. We need **mirrors**. We don't know what to do with other worlds. A single world, our own, suffices us; but **we can't accept it** for what it is. We are searching for an **ideal** image of our own world; we go in quest of a planet, of a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past."
